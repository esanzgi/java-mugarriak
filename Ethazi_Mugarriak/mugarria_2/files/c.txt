C is a general-purpose programming language that was originally developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It is a high-level language that is compiled, meaning that programs written in C are first translated into machine language before being executed by a computer.

C has been widely used for developing operating systems, device drivers, software applications, embedded systems, and many other types of software. It is known for its efficiency, portability, and low-level control over computer hardware.

C is a structured programming language, meaning that it supports the use of functions, loops, and conditional statements to create organized and reusable code. It also supports pointers, which are variables that store memory addresses, and provide a way to access and manipulate data in memory directly.

C has influenced many other programming languages, and is still widely used today. It is considered a foundational language that every programmer should know, and is often taught in computer science courses.
