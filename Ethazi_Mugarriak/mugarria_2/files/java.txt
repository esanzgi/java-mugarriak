Java is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that was first released in 1995 by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation). It is an object-oriented language that is designed to be platform-independent, meaning that Java programs can run on any computer or device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.

Java is often used for developing enterprise applications, web applications, mobile apps, and games. It is known for its security features, performance, and scalability.

Java code is compiled into bytecode, which is a platform-independent format that can be executed by any JVM. This makes Java programs highly portable and easy to distribute.

Java supports a rich set of libraries and tools, including the Java Development Kit (JDK) and the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which make it easier to write, test, and debug Java code.

Java has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and is widely used by developers and organizations of all sizes. It is also used extensively in academia, and is a popular choice for teaching programming in introductory computer science courses.
